Working on design patterns used in swift


**Singleton Pattern**
Definition:

The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance while providing a global access point to it.

**Key Characteristics:**

A private initializer prevents the direct instantiation of the class.
A static instance variable holds the single instance.
A global access method provides the instance.

**Use Cases**

Logging: Maintaining a single logger instance across the application.
Database Connection: To ensure only one connection pool is created.
Shared Resources: For global configurations, caches, or settings.
Thread-Safe Operations: Centralized instance to prevent race conditions.

**Advantages**

Controlled Access: Ensures only one instance exists globally.
Reduced Memory Usage: Avoids creating multiple instances of a resource-heavy object.
Global Point of Access: Simplifies sharing data or resources.
Lazy Initialization: The instance is created only when accessed, optimizing performance.

**Disadvantages**

Global State: Overusing singletons can lead to tightly coupled code and global dependencies.
Difficult to Test: Hard to mock or replace singletons during unit testing, leading to brittle tests.
Concurrency Issues: If not implemented carefully, thread-safety problems may arise.
Hidden Dependencies: Makes dependencies less obvious, affecting code readability and maintainability.
